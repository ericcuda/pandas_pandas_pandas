The application references a csv file (purchase_data.csv) located in the Resource directory
and the same level as the sourced .py file.
The application will analyze the input data from the file and provide data analysis throughout

Heroes of Pymoli Data Overview Analysis
(also included in the ipynb file)
---------------------------------------
Of the 576 total number of unique players identified in the 780 purhcases, 84% were male, 14% were female, remaining were not disclosed.  This indicates that males are the main gender purhcasing games, but there are probably opportunities to gain in the female segment.

The 20-24 age bracket consisted of 45% of the purchasers, with the 15-19 age bracket second at 19% of the sample.  Percentages begin declining beyond the age of 29.

The most popular game (Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm	) is also the most profitable item.  Further investigation of purhcase breakdown and marketing of this title, would be beneficial for new products.
